    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We have data from an Audiobook app in a .csv that relates only to the audio versions of books. Each row in the database represents a customer who has made at least one purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several variables: Customer ID, Book length in mins_avg (average of all purchases), Book length in minutes_sum (sum of all purchases), Price Paid_avg (average of all purchases), Price paid_sum (sum of all purchases), Review (a Boolean variable), Review (out of 10), Total minutes listened, Completion (from 0 to 1), Support requests (number), and Last visited minus purchase date (in days).\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know if a customer will buy from the company again. The main idea is that if a customer has a low probability of coming back, there is no reason to spend any money on advertizing to him/her. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company. If we can focus our efforts ONLY on customers that are likely to convert again, we can incease savings and improve profitability. Moreover, this model can identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again. Identifying new customers creates value and growth opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to the model will be all of these variables excluding customer ID, as it is completely arbitrary. It's more like a name, than a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The targets are a Boolean variable (so 0, or 1). We are taking a period of 2 years in our inputs, and the next 6 months as targets. So, in fact, we are predicting if: based on the last 2 years of activity and engagement, a customer will convert in the next 6 months. 6 months sounds like a reasonable time. If they don't convert after 6 months, chances are they've gone to a competitor or didn't like the Audiobook way of digesting information. This is a classification problem with two classes: won't buy and will buy, represented by 0s and 1s. \n"
